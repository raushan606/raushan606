### 👋 Hi there I'm Raushan Kumar;
- 👨‍💻 I'm some sort of a full-stack developer?
- 🌱 I work a lot with Java especially with Spring Boot and I'm afraid for languages such as Rust!
- 🎮 I like gaming but I never know which games I wanna play and never play a game for long!
- 👯‍♀️ I like to discuss coding with others and learn more.
- 📫 I do not write blog posts and my twitter is mostly used when I'm bored or waiting for something.
- ❓ Want to know more about me? You can always contact me via serval social medias!
